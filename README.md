This Github repository holds the secrets to all projects I have undertaken on my way to completing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Adelaide.

I chose to pursue this Masters degree as I believe the automation of traditional processes/tasks with AI/ML will not only empower the world's future, but will enable industry professionals to operate at a higher level of abstraction and meaning - getting away from the rudimentary and repetitive tasks, and focussing on using data to educate the decisions that truly matter.

I commenced this degree within Trimester 1 of 2024, and am on track to graduate following Trimester 1 of 2026.
